**Description:**
This is a shop application where users can view a variety of items and their prices. The app provide a clean interface for browsing items and displays detailed information about each item. Users can search for items using a search bar that queries the name and description of products.

**Stack**

* Frontend: React with Material UI (MUI) for the user interface
* Backend: Node.js with Express.js for the server and API
* Database: SQLite managed via Sequelize ORM
* Tooling: Parcel for frontend bundling, Jest and Supertest for testing, and dotenv for environment variables

**Key Features:**

1. Product Catalog: Users can browse a variety of items, each with detailed information including name, price, description, category, and image.
2. Search Functionality: A search bar allows users to find products by name or description.
3. Product Details: Clicking on a product displays more detailed information about it.
4. Add, Edit, and Delete Items: Users can add new products, edit existing ones, or delete items from the inventory through a user-friendly form.
5. Responsive UI: The frontend is built with React and Material UI, providing a clean, modern, and responsive interface.
6. RESTful API: The backend exposes RESTful endpoints for all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on products.
7. Database Integration: Product data is stored and managed using a SQLite database via Sequelize ORM.
8. Automated Testing: The backend includes automated tests for API endpoints to ensure reliability.
9. Modular Code Structure: The project is organized into clear folders for routes, models, components, and tests, making it easy to maintain and extend.
10. Collaboration Ready: The codebase and documentation are structured to support teamwork and onboarding of new contributors.


# Reflections

Contributing to the Titan Store project has been a rewarding and enriching experience. While I already had some familiarity with React, this project allowed me to deepen my skills and collaborate closely with my peers. Here are some of the main things I gained and enjoyed:

## React Skills Growth
- I enhanced my React skills by building and refining reusable components, managing state, and handling user interactions in more complex scenarios.
- I became more confident in structuring React projects for maintainability and scalability, and in integrating the frontend with a RESTful API.

## Collaboration and Communication
- Working alongside the other two apprentices was a highlight of this project. We communicated regularly, shared ideas, and supported each other through challenges.
- Our teamwork and open communication made problem-solving more efficient and enjoyable. I appreciated learning from my peers' perspectives and approaches to coding challenges.

## Key Takeaways
- Full-stack project exposure: I gained a deeper understanding of how the frontend and backend interact in a modern web application.
- Code organization: I strengthened my understanding of best practices for organizing code and documentation for clarity and maintainability.
- Testing and feedback: I further developed my appreciation for automated testing and the importance of feedback in the development process.

Overall, this project helped me grow as a fullstack developer and teammate, and I look forward to applying these skills and experiences in future projects.
