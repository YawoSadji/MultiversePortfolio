**Description:**
This project is a React-based chatbot application called SOXBOT, designed to assist users with SOX compliance, CPRA, and Segregation of Duties topics. It uses Google's Gemini generative AI for chat responses and integrates with Firebase for authentication (Google sign-in) and Firestore for storing user chat history. Users can log in, chat about compliance topics, and view or delete their chat history.

**Stack**
* Frontend Framework: React (with Vite for development/build)
* UI Components: React Bootstrap, React Icons, Framer Motion
* Authentication & Database: Firebase (Google sign-in, Firestore)
* AI Integration: Google Gemini Generative AI (via @google/generative-ai)
* Routing: React Router DOM
* State Management: React hooks, react-firebase-hooks
* Notifications: React Toastify
* Testing: Vitest, @testing-library/react, @testing-library/jest-dom, Jest
* Linting: ESLint
* Other: dotenv for environment variables

**Key Features**
* AI Chatbot: Interact with SOXBOT for guidance on SOX compliance, CPRA, and Segregation of Duties.
* Google Authentication: Secure login using Google accounts via Firebase.
* Chat History: View, store, and delete your chat conversations, synced with Firestore.
* Responsive UI: Modern, mobile-friendly interface using React Bootstrap and Framer Motion.
* Real-time Updates: Instant chat and history updates with Firebase integration.
* Notifications: User feedback and alerts with React Toastify.
* Unit Tested: Core components and logic covered by automated tests.
* Environment Configurable: Uses dotenv for managing API keys and environment variables.

# Reflections
Working on this project has been a valuable learning experience. I gained hands-on skills in building a full-stack React application, integrating AI services, and using Firebase for authentication and data storage. Throughout the project, I significantly improved my React skill s thus becoming more confident with functional components, hooks for state management, and organizing code for scalability. I learned how to manage state with React hooks, handle user authentication securely, and connect to external APIs like Google Gemini. Collaborating on this project also improved my understanding of modern development tools such as Vite, ESLint, and automated testing with Vitest.
