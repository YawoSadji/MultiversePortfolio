# My Multiverse bootcamp / Verizon Thrive Apprenticeship Portfolio

Welcome to my Multiverse Bootcamp Portfolio.
This repository showcases the Five major projects I've worked on during my bootcamp journey, along with reflections on my learning and growth.

##Overview of my Apprenticeship - Host Company: Verizon - Duration: 12 months - [Link to deployed Portfolio Website](To add)

    During my apprenticeship at Verizon, I had the opportunity to work on some Java/ Springboot codebase for the SOX compliance team.
        - API integration
        - API data troubleshooting
        - Improved codebase to increase process efficiency
    I also learned RPA development using UiPath and built automations for my team.
        - Transformed Business requirements into PDD(Process Definition Document)
        - Built strong and efficient code using the ReFramework
        - Built tests
    My biggest impact during this apprenticeship was reducing my team's manual effort and risk of human error in our processes and saving thousand of hours with our automations.

## About Me

My name is Yawo Sadji and I have a strong passion for software development. I've always enjoyed writing small scripts to run things here and there on my computer but in November 2023, I decided to take a break from my job as a hybrid Field Tech/Tech Support to focus on becoming a fullstack SWE. I then learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript and also Core Java. After that I had the chance to be selected by Multiverse to be part of the 2024-2025 Verizon Thrive Apprenticeship Program. These last 12 months have been an amazing journey. I've learned to build different projects across different stacks, collaborated with other apprentices and also worked on companies projects where I collaborated with other developers and learned from mentors and seniors. The bootcamp and the apprenticeship have helped me grow so much as a Fullstack SWE. This portfolio highlights my technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and dedication to continuous learning.
