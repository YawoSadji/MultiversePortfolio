## About Me

My name is Yawo Sadji and I have a strong passion for software development. I have always known how to write small scripts to run things here and there on my computer but in Novemver 2023, I decided to take a break from my job as a hybrid Field Tech/Tech Support to focus on becoming a fullstack SWE. I then learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript and also Core Java. After that I had the chance to be selected by Multiverse to be part of the 2024-2025 Verizon Thrive Apprenticeship Program. These last 12 months have been an amazing journey. I've learned to build different projects across different stacks, collaborated with other apprentices and also worked on companies projects where I've collaborated with other developers and learned from mentors. The bootcamp and the apprenticeship have helped me grow so much as a Fullstack SWE. This portfolio highlights my technical skills, problem-solving abilities, and dedication to continuous learning.
