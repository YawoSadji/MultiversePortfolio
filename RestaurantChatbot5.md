# Reflections

Working on the RestaurantChatbot project was a valuable learning experience, especially in implementing CI/CD pipelines. I gained hands-on experience with GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment, which helped me understand the importance of continuous integration and delivery in maintaining code quality and accelerating development cycles. Setting up automated workflows ensured that every code change was tested and deployed efficiently, reducing manual errors and increasing team productivity. This project not only strengthened my technical skills in React and Firebase, but also gave me practical insight into industry-standard DevOps practices.
